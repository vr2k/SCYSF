    <p>contra-diction <i>provides an alternate way of thinking that utilises visual references to explore concepts like - but which are rooted in - our shared reality (the ontological condition of the Universe). the material immateriality of materiality in the age of the immaterial is not just a matter of space. it is of life. it is of the Universe. in the Universe, materiality of existence is immaterial. but, in the </i>contra-dictionary<i>, it is not. could trees, plants and atoms be more?</i></p>
